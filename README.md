This repository is a collection of my early C programming . It serves as a record of my learning journey and experimentation with the C language.

These codes were created during my first year of coding, when I was just starting to familiarize myself with programming concepts.
As I was new to optimization techniques, these projects may not be optimized for time and space complexity.

After this initial phase, I progressed to C++ for DSA and various online platforms where I focused on solving problems with optimization in mind .

Each file within this repository represents a step in my understanding of C programming concepts. These projects cover a range of topics, including:
Basic C syntax and data types
Control flow statements (if-else, loops)
Functions and modular programming
Pointers and memory management
Array and string manipulation
Structures etc
By exploring these, you can gain insights into the fundamental principles of C programming and how they can be applied to solve various problems.
